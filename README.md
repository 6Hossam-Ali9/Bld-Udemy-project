# Bld-Udemy-project
This is Phase 3 of the project where I have added Bootstrap styles with top categories section and I have also used carousel from Bootstrap to create a slider for the courses 

## Deployment

To deploy this project you will need to have json-server installed or you can just install it globally using this 

```bash
  npm install -g json-server
```
then run 

```bash
  json-server --watch data/db.json 
```
# Important
json-server should be running on port 3000

Now, you can try the project.
